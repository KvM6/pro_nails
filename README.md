# Pro Nails

## About this project

I wanted to create a page for my portfolio that reprezent some of my skills.

In this project I wanted to try to work with Vite for the first time.

I'm open to collaboration, guest artist positions, or full-time/part-time opportunities.

### Tech note

This project is built from scratch with modern tools to show I can learn quickly and care about clean code & great user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** + **Tailwind CSS** (for responsive, minimal styling)
- **JavaScript** (vanilla + small interactions)
- **Libraries** (mostly for animations)
- **Vite** (fast dev server & build tool — my first Vite project!)
- Deployed on **GitHub Pages**

Hope to create something beautiful for **you** soon 😉.
